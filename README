### Installation

To use my configuration with a new box just run:

zsh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackaugusto/dotfiles/master/install.sh)

Most of the script works with bash, except for the array manipulation used for installing Arch's packages.


### About it

#### Terminal

[`alacritty`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) + [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) + [`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net)

- `alacritty` is noticiably faster emulator, but it does not work well with wayland
- `tmux` is a comfortable multiplexer, better than `screen` (it just doesn't support serial ports)
- `zsh` autocompletion is unmatched, better the `bash`, `fish`, `sh`, `ksh`

#### Editor

[`neovim`](https://neovim.io/) + [`dein`](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim/) + multiple plugins

- `neovim` was better then vim7 because of workers. Mostly compatible, only
  thing I miss is `alt + <letter>` for auto-escaping.
- `dein` is the most straighforward plugin manager, `Vundle` is slow,
  `NeoBundle` was the older version from the same author of `dein`, `pathogen`
  (never tried vim-plug).

Plugins:

- tpope/vim-surround for editting awesomenes
- Shougo/deoplete.nvim for lightweight completion engine (still better then language servers)
- zchee/deoplete-jedi deoplete for python
- davidhalter/jedi-vim for goto sweetness
- vim-scripts/python.vim for good identation support
- tpope/vim-fugitive for gitmagic
- sheerun/vim-polyglot all-in package to have a good enviroment to program
- tpope/vim-repeat to have a better .
- Shougo/neosnippet.vim because it works well with neoplete
- junegunn/vim-easy-align to write aligned markup
- Valloric/YouCompleteMe for C/C++ coding
